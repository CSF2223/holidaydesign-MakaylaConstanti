                    <p>The "winter" holidays occur in the summer in the Southern Hemisphere.
                    Around Christmas, the temperature in Australia can reach 84 degrees Fahrenheit. 
                    So it only makes sense that many Australians visit the beach. 
                    Swimming, picnics, and volleyball are activities that families and friends enjoy. 
                    Some surfing Santas will frequently show up. 
                    A few of Sydney's beaches are well renowned for being popular destinations for travellers and tourists from abroad. 
                    Alcohol bans have been put in place as a result of recent out-of-control parties held there.
